  [![An introduction to digital signage with Screenly OSE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/FQte5yP0azE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQte5yP0azE)

  ## Introduction

  Screenly Open Source Edition (OSE) is free digital signage software that is backed by our community and maintained by Screenly, Inc.

  With Screenly OSE, a monitor/TV and a Raspberry Pi, you can create a remotely managed screen that can display:

  - images
  - video
  - web pages

  Thanks to Balena [OpenFleets](https://hub.balena.io/organizations/screenly_ose/fleets), you benefit from having automatic updates. As soon as updates are shipped, they will be deployed to your device.
